				"Likely Vanessa was now stronger than she had ever been, the magic no longer just a tool, but an integral part of her nature." +
				" But as is often the case with great power, it was now beyond her control." +
				" From dusk, until dawn, and through every night it teased her with sensations beyond comprehension but" +
				" without a mind of her own, she could never herself reach the climax she so desired." +
				"\n\n" + 
				" Luckily, the Casino could provide. Like a chalice filled to it's very brim, unable to empty on its own, with just a little help, she would spill her juices." + 
				" Very little was all it took. An order from a master for her thoughts to focus on, if just for a split second, was all that was needed for Vanessa, now Vivi, to reach her heaven." +
				"\n\n" +
				"Setting her up with a master, or a dozen, was easy enough for the Casino, and she became a popular pet. Always begging and pleading, in her own whimsical way, for the climax she so desired," + 
				" rarely would she reach one without soon licking her masters feet again, wishing for another." +
				"\n\n" +
				"Vanessa had sought the power of the Casino, and Vivi had gained them in full." +
