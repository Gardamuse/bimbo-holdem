# Bimbo Holdem Poker
This is a repository for Bimbo Holdem Poker, a NSFW erotic transformation poker game which was first [published at DeviantArt](https://www.deviantart.com/gardamuse/art/Bimbo-Holdem-Poker-584820811) 2016-01-17 and now resides primarily on [BlushingDefeat](https://www.blushingdefeat.com/bimbo-holdem-poker/). As such, this source was made public approximately 3 years after the games release and 1 year after the last update.

The game was developed using [FlashDevelop](http://www.flashdevelop.org).
